        <p> Take one gallon of bleach, place it in the container, and begin heating it. While this     solution heats, weigh out 63 grams of potassium chloride and add this to the bleach       being heated. Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer, and boil     until you get a reading of 1.3. If using a battery hydrometer, boil until you read a       FULL charge.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it is between room temperature and 0C. Filter out the crystals that have formed and save them. Boil this solution again and cool as before. Filter and save the crystals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56 grams per 100 milliliters distilled water. Heat this solution until it boils and allow to cool. Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling. This process of purification is called "fractional crystallization". These crystals should be relatively pure potassium chlorate.
            Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to drive off all moisture.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Now, melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax. Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 90 parts potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above) into a plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until intimately mixed. Allow all gasoline to evaporate.
            Finally, place this explosive into a cool, dry place. Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfides, and phosphorous compounds. This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3 grams in a cube and dipped in wax until water proof. These block type charges guarantee the highest detonation velocity. Also, a blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presence of the afore mentioned compounds (sulfur, sulfides, etc.) results in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive and will possibly decompose explosively while in storage. You should never store homemade explosives, and you must use EXTREME caution at all times while performing the processes.
