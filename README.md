WAR CHILD CLOTHING WEBSTORE

Extremely inexperienced coder trying to set up a webstore for the clothing that I make. All I'm looking to make is a basic website with a homepage, shop, and a form that can be submitted to contact me. 

The framework for the homepage is set up for the most part besides its need for a more responsive navigation bar and social media icons to visit my accounts on Instagram, Twitter, etc.

The shop and contact form still need to be made. I'll try to integrate a PayPal widget at some point, and I also need to make some sort of backend to collect all of the information from the contact form.
