WAR CHILD CLOTHING WEBSTORE

Extremely inexperienced coder trying to set up a webstore for the clothing that I make. All I'm looking to make is a basic website with a homepage, shop, and a form that can be submitted to contact me. 

The framework for the homepage is set up for the most part besides its need for a more responsive navigation bar and social media icons to visit my accounts on Instagram, Twitter, etc.

The shop has been made. PayPal buttons were integrated for ease of purchase and two of my products were added.

The contact form still needs to be made, and I still have to find a way to create a backend to collect all of the information that users send.
